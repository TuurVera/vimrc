# VIMRC repo

This repo contains my personal vimrc.


## Installation

Simply clone or downloatd the `myvimrc` file somewhere and have vim load it as it's vimrc file.

The simplest method is to reference this file in the default vim via the `source` command.

To install all the plugings you'll need to install [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and then in vim execute this commande:

in vim: `:PluginInstall`
from command line: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
